            <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
            <p>
                We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
            </p>
            <hr id="t26hr"/>
            <p>
                You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing 
                the border color; all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span>
                That prevents it from messing with the line height.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Notice how the borders double up here:
        </p>
        <div id="t26d1">
            This div has a red border
        </div>
        <div id="t26d2">
            This div has a blue border
        </div>

        <p>
            Notice how this fixes the borders:
        </p>
        <div id="t26d3">
            This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners
        </div>
        <div id="t26d4">
            This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners
        </div>
    </body>
