            <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
            <p>
                This page looks much clear now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of taxt is blue</span> <span class="fancy">and this span has font-family of cursive,</span> 
                because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, <span id="t25s">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
